% Let's take a look at S_3
%
% 1, x, x^2, y, xy, x^2 y
%
% production rules: x^3 = 1, y^2 = 1, yx = x^2 y
element('1')@0;
element('x')@0;
element('y')@0;

% in order to produce new elements, we need to pick ids for them.
% we could do it one by one, using successor.
% it would be more correct to use symbols, that doesn't imply any ordering
% we also could pick several symbols at once, ensuring that they are different via
% choose expression.
